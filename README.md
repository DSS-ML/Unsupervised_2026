# Unsupervised_2026
Data Science course on Unsupervised Machine Learning, combining theory, mathematics, and hands-on Python labs.

## Course objectives

The main goal of the course is to provide students with a **structured understanding of unsupervised learning** methods, emphasizing:

- how different algorithms encode different assumptions about data structure,
- the role of geometry, distance, and scaling in high-dimensional spaces,
- the conceptual differences between distance-based, density-based, and probabilistic approaches,
- the connections between unsupervised learning, representation learning, and downstream tasks.


## Course contents

The course is organized around the following topics:

- Geometric foundations of unsupervised learning  
  (feature spaces, distance metrics, scaling, curse of dimensionality)

- Clustering methods  
  (K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models)

- Dimensionality reduction and representation learning  
  (PCA, non-linear methods for visualization and exploration)

- Anomaly and novelty detection  
  (density-based approaches and reconstruction-based methods)

- Introduction to autoencoders and unsupervised deep learning

- Applications and case studies, including recommender systems
